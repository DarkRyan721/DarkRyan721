# 💫 About Me

I am a **Mechatronics Engineer** with a strong focus on **back-end systems, scientific computing, and computational physics**.

My work centers on developing robust and scalable software for engineering applications, with particular emphasis on **simulation, and physics-based modeling**. I primarily use **Python, C/C++, and Linux-based workflows**, applying sound software engineering practices and version control.

I am especially interested in simulation-driven engineering, aerospace-related systems, and computational research.
